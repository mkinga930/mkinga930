### My Projects:

- **Turing College Projects**: During my course at Turing College, I created several projects which are currently private.
  In these projects, I used analytical methods such as **data cleaning, cohort analysis, retention analysis, churn analysis, funnel analysis, customer segmentation, RFM & CLV, and conducted A/B testing and logistic regression.** 
Tools used include **BigQuery, Google Sheets, Tableau, and Python libraries (with Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab)**.

  I'm happy to discuss these experiences in a private conversation.

- **[Data Preliminary Adventure](https://github.com/mkinga930/data_preliminary_adventure)** -> My first data analysis project that involved using:
  - **Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib**
