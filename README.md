### About Me:

- 👩‍💼 I'm a Test & Analysis Engineer.
- 💻 I transitioned to IT 3 years ago, focusing on software validation using Python.

- 🎓 I completed postgraduate studies as a Python Developer, , where I was first introduced to data analysis using Pandas, 
Numpy, and Matplotlib. This sparked my interest in the field and set the foundation for my data analytics journey.
- 📊 Currently expanding my skills in Data Analytics at Turing College, mastering SQL, Tableau, and various analytical methods.

- 🧬 I have a background in Biotechnology, where I developed a production line for a biosimilar drug and analyzed process data 
to identify areas for improvement.

- 🚀 Always ready to collaborate on exciting projects.

### My Projects:

- **Turing College Projects**: During my course at Turing College, I created several projects which are currently private. In these projects, I used analytical methods such as data cleaning, cohort analysis, retention analysis, churn analysis, funnel analysis, customer segmentation, RFM & CLV, and conducted A/B testing and logistic regression. 
Tools used include BigQuery, Google Sheets, Tableau, and Python libraries (with Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab). 
I'm happy to discuss these experiences in a private conversation.

- **[Data Preliminary Adventure](https://github.com/mkinga930/data_preliminary_adventure)** -> This project involved data analysis using:
  - **Pandas**
  - **Numpy**
  - **Seaborn**
  - **Matplotlib**


### My Goal:

Seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst to apply my acquired knowledge and solve business problems using data-driven insights.
